# Jarvis

## Overview
Jarvis is a small voice control script that listens for commands and sends them
to a remote Discord music bot using HTTP requests.

Get a key from [here](https://console.picovoice.ai/signup) and create a new file
named `.env` in this directory containing your Porcupine and Discord details:

```
PORCUPINE_KEY="<YOUR-PORCUPINE-KEY>"
GUILD_ID="<DISCORD-GUILD-ID>"
USER_ID="<YOUR-DISCORD-USER-ID>"
VOICE_CHANNEL_ID="<TARGET-VOICE-CHANNEL-ID>"
PIPER_MODEL="voices/en_US-danny-low.onnx"
```

## Setup
1. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install pynput pyaudio vosk pvporcupine numpy piper-tts requests python-dotenv
```

2. Download the Vosk English model from
   [here](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models/vosk-model-en-us-0.22.zip) and
   extract its contents into the provided `model` directory.

3. The repo ships with the lightweight `en_US-danny-low` voice model under
   `voices/`. To use another Piper voice, download it from the
   [Piper voice database](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper/releases) and set the
   `PIPER_MODEL` environment variable to the path of the `.onnx` file.


## Usage
`python jarvis.py`

Then say: _"Jarvis, play hampster dance"_ (using your default microphone) and Jarvis
will instruct the music bot to play it. Works with other common commands too:
