# Jarvis

## Overview
Jarvis is a hacky script that will listen to your voice and send music bot commands in a Discord window of your choosing.

Get a key from https://console.picovoice.ai/signup and dump it into a file called `.env` in this directory. The contents should look like so:

`PORCUPINE_KEY="<YOUR-KEY-HERE>"`

## Setup
`pip install pynput pygetwindow pyautogui screeninfo pyaudio vosk pvporcupine numpy`

Put Discord on your second monitor, justified to the right so the text box is on the lower-right (told you this was hacky).

## Usage
`python jarvis.py`

Then say: _"Jarvis, play hampster dance"_ and it will type /play [tab] hampster dance in your target window! Works with other common commands too:
